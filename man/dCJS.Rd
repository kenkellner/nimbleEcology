\arguments{
\item{x}{capture history vector of 0s (not captured) and 1s (captured).
Include the initial capture, so \code{x[1]} should equal 1.}

\item{probSurvive}{survival probability, either a time-independent scalar
(for dCJS_s*) or a time-dependent vector (for dCJS_v*) with length
\code{len - 1}.}

\item{probCapture}{capture probability, either a time-independent scalar
(for dCJS_*s) or a time-dependent vector (for dCJS_*v) with length \code{len}.
If a vector, first element is ignored, as the total probability is conditioned
on the capture at \code{t = 1}.}

\item{len}{length of capture history. Should equal \code{length(x)}}

\item{log}{TRUE or 1 to return log probability. FALSE or 0 to return probability.}

\item{n}{number of random draws, each returning a vector of length
\code{len}. Currently only \code{n = 1} is supported, but the
argument exists for standardization of "\code{r}" functions.}
}
\value{
For \code{dCJS_**}: the probability (or likelihood) or log probability of observation vector \code{x}.

For \code{rCJS_**}: a simulated capture history, \code{x}.

\description{
\code{dCJS_**} and \code{rCJS_**} provide Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture
distributions that can be used directly from R or in \code{nimble}
models.
}
\details{
These nimbleFunctions provide distributions that can be used directly in R or
in \code{nimble} hierarchical models (via \code{\link[nimble]{nimbleCode}}
and \code{\link[nimble]{nimbleModel}}).

The letters following the 'dCJS_' indicate whether survival and/or capture
probabilities, in that order, are scalar (s, meaning the probability applies
to every \code{x[t]}) or vector (v, meaning the probability is a vector
aligned with \code{x}).  When \code{probCapture} and/or \code{probSurvive} is
a vector, they must be the same length as \code{x}.

It is important to use the time indexing correctly for survival.
\code{probSurvive[t]} is the survival probabilty from time \code{t} to time
\code{t + 1}. When a vector, \code{probSurvive} may have length greater than
\code{length(x) - 1}, but all values beyond that index are ignored.

Time indexing for detection is more obvious: \code{probDetect[t]} is the
detection probability at time \code{t}.

When called from R, the \code{len} argument to \code{dCJS_**} is not
necessary. It will default to the length of \code{x}.  When used in
\code{nimble} model code (via \code{nimbleCode}), \code{len} must be provided
(even though it may seem redundant).

For more explanation, see package vignette
(\code{vignette("Introduction_to_nimbleEcology")}).

Compared to writing \code{nimble} models with a discrete latent state for
true alive/dead status at each time and a separate scalar datum for each
observation, use of these distributions allows one to directly sum
(marginalize) over the discrete latent states and calculate the probability
of the detection history for one individual jointly.

These are \code{nimbleFunction}s written in the format of user-defined
distributions for NIMBLE's extension of the BUGS model language. More
information can be found in the NIMBLE User Manual at
\href{https://r-nimble.org}{https://r-nimble.org}.

When using these distributions in a \code{nimble} model, the left-hand side
will be used as \code{x}, and the user should not provide the \code{log}
argument.

For example, in \code{nimble} model code,

\code{captures[i, 1:T] ~ dCSJ_ss(survive, capture, T)}

declares a vector node, \code{captures[i, 1:T]}, (detection history for individual
\code{i},  for example) that follows a CJS distribution
with scalar survival probability \code{survive} and scalar capture probability \code{capture}
(assuming \code{survive} and \code{capture} are defined elsewhere in the model).

This will invoke (something like) the following call to \code{dCJS_ss} when \code{nimble} uses the
model such as for MCMC:

\code{dCJS_ss(captures[i, 1:T], survive, capture, len = T, log = TRUE)}

If an algorithm using a \code{nimble} model with this declaration
needs to generate a random draw for \code{captures[i, 1:T]}, it
will make a similar invocation of \code{rCJS_ss}, with \code{n = 1}.

If both survival and capture probabilities are time-dependent, use

\code{captures[i,1:T] ~ dCSJ_vv(survive[1:(T-1)], capture[1:T], T)}

and so on for each combination of time-dependent and time-independent parameters.

\section{Notes for use with automatic differentiation}{


The \code{dCJS_**} distributions should all work for models and algorithms
that use nimble's automatic differentiation (AD) system. In that system,
some kinds of values are "baked in" (cannot be changed) to the AD calculations
from the first call, unless and until the AD calculations are reset. For
the \code{dCJS_**} distributions, the lengths of vector inputs and the data
(\code{x}) values themselves are baked in. These can be different for different
iterations through a for loop (or nimble model declarations with different indices,
for example), but the lengths and data values for each specific iteration
will be "baked in" after the first call. \bold{In other words, it is assumed that
\code{x} are data and are not going to change.}

\examples{
# Set up constants and initial values for defining the model
dat <- c(1,1,0,0,0) # A vector of observations
probSurvive <- c(0.6, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1)
probCapture <- 0.4


# Define code for a nimbleModel
nc <- nimbleCode({
  x[1:4] ~ dCJS_vs(probSurvive[1:4], probCapture, len = 4)
  probCapture ~ dunif(0,1)
  for (i in 1:4) probSurvive[i] ~ dunif(0, 1)
})

# Build the model, providing data and initial values
CJS_model <- nimbleModel(nc, data = list(x = dat),
                         inits = list(probSurvive = probSurvive,
                                      probCapture = probCapture))

# Calculate log probability of data from the model
CJS_model$calculate()
# Use the model for a variety of other purposes...
