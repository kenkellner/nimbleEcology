Release notes for each version of nimbleEcologyy


0.4.1
-- Fix a bug in dBetaBinom and dBetaBinom_One distribution registration that prevented
those from being used directly in a model (but did not cause silent errors)

0.4.0
-- Implement N-mixture extensions for the beta binomial and negative binomial
submodel variations.
-- Allow a tolerance of 1e-6 in the sums of the "init" probabilities in dHMM and
dDHMM. This addresses inconsistencies in R/C++ floating point numbers which led
to a phenomenon where sum(init) == 1 in R but sum(init) != 1 in C++.

0.3.1
-- Fixed rounding errors in edge cases of dNmixture with many observations.
Thanks to NIMBLE developer Chris Paciorek for the algorithm.

0.3.0

-- Fixed an internal problem with dHMM and dDHMM resulting in a mismatch between documentation and internal behavior
-- Reworked roxygen documentation
-- Fixed issue with vignette installation
-- Added CITATION file

0.2.2

-- Adjusted internal calculation of dNmixture to avoid Inf overflow at large values of lambda, small values of p

0.2.1

-- Addressed typos in documentation examples

0.2.0

-- Added N-mixture models, dNmixture_*.

0.1.0

-- Initial release of nimbleEcology.
